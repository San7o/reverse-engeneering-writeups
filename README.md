# reverse-engeneering-writeups

This is my personal collection of writeups on reverse engeneering
challenges. I am also preparing useful cheatsheets that are 
available on this repo. I will soon make a tool to centralize all
this knowledge into an easy-to-use program.

Check out `GDB_CHEATSHEET.md`, `R2_CHEATSHEET.md`, `ASM_CHEATSHEET.md`

## Nice CTF sites:
